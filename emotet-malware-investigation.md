- **Severity:** Medium
- **Event ID:** 85
- **Event Time:** Mar 22, 2021, 09:06 PM
- **Detection Rule:** SOC109 – Emotet Malware Detected
- **Analyst Level:** Security Analyst
- **Environment:** Simulated SOC Lab

## Host Information
- **Hostname:** JackRamsey
- **Domain:** LetsDefend
- **Operating System:** Windows Server 2019 (64-bit)
- **IP Address:** 172.16.17.23
- **Primary User:** Jack
- **System Role:** Server
- **Last Login:** Sep 13, 2021, 10:32 PM

## Initial Indicators
- A security alert was triggered indicating potential Emotet malware activity.
- The alert was associated with a suspicious document file detected on the system.
- The detection suggested malicious behavior consistent with known Emotet infection patterns.

## File and Source Details
- **File Name:** 1word.doc
- **File Size:** 188.95 KB
- **File Hash (MD5):** 349d13ca99ab03869548d75b99e5a1d0
- **Source Address:** 172.16.17.45
- **Source Hostname:** RichardPRD
- **Device Action:** Cleaned

## Logs and Data Analyzed
- Endpoint security logs detailing file detection and remediation.
- Network telemetry related to the source and affected hosts.
- Malware detection alerts generated by endpoint protection controls.
- External malware reputation analysis using VirusTotal.

## Investigation Steps
1. Reviewed the alert details to confirm malware classification and affected host.
2. Examined file metadata, including name, hash, and size, to assess potential risk.
3. Analyzed endpoint security logs to determine how the file was handled by security controls.
4. Checked for signs of command-and-control communication or follow-on malicious activity.
5. Verified that the malicious file was successfully cleaned from the system.
6. Performed an external reputation lookup on the file hash to validate the malware classification.

## Findings
- The detected file exhibited characteristics consistent with Emotet malware delivery mechanisms, commonly associated with malicious document attachments.
- VirusTotal reputation analysis confirmed the file as malicious, with multiple security vendors flagging the hash.
- Endpoint security controls successfully cleaned the file before further compromise occurred.
- No evidence of additional malicious activity or lateral movement was observed after remediation.

## Conclusion
- **Alert Classification:** True Positive
- **Impact:** Malware detected on a server system with potential risk of further compromise if not contained.
- **Status:** Threat successfully remediated by endpoint security controls.

## Recommended Actions
- Confirm the affected system remains clean and stable through continued monitoring.
- Review document and email security controls to reduce exposure to malicious attachments.
- Monitor other hosts for similar indicators of compromise associated with Emotet campaigns.
- Maintain updated endpoint protection and threat intelligence feeds.
